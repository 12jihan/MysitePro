    <p class="is-size-5">As a developer, I remind myself everyday that my role in life is to â€œdevelopâ€. If I
      considered everything
      that Iâ€™ve ever worked on as completed, then my career title would make the least amount of sense, and should be
      changed to â€œfinisherâ€. Whether it be a project thatâ€™s started or ourselves as people living day to day
      life. there always be something that we need to improve. This is why Iâ€™m passionate about what I do, because
      everyday I get a new opportunity to learn how to better myself in my career path and my life, while helping
      others do the same. Itâ€™s more than a job, itâ€™s a lifestyle.</p>
